## Hello, World

Hi, I'm Sang.<br/>
I am Frontend Developer at [GForces]. After completing the study program at [FPT Polytechnic], I worked as an intern at an Agency company. I left intern work to start to work as a real Frontend Developer at a company based in Singapore.<br/>
I am passionate about helping teams improve the quality of their software, and do it more efficiently and securely. I regularly blog at [https://www.ngocsangyem.dev] and can be found on Twitter at [@ngocsangyem] and on [github.com/ngocsangyem].<br/>
Please check my [resume] if you wish to know more about me.

## Start today not tomorrow

_My motto to live by._
{:.lead}

> "Everything you care about, everything you are about, needs to begin today or it may never happen."

## Tomorrow never comes

What's something that you've put off doing till tomorrow? Did you really do it? I didn't think so.

Here is a list of things I said I'd do tomorrow:

- Clean the house
- Fix bugs
- Write a blog post
- Go to Gym

Many of those I pledged to start months ago. All with the same promise: Eh, I'll do that tomorrow.

## It's time to act

If it's worth the effort, you shouldn't wait. If it's not, then simply tell the truth: I don't want that badly enough. You'll feel better about yourself once you've started. Trust me. It gets easier as you go.

## Starting is hard

It requires courage and perseverance and all kinds of gumption. That's why most people simply talk about it, but never do it. That's why it's the hard part.

But starting is necessary. It's crucial to making your mark and leaving a legacy.
