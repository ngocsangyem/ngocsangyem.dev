## Hello, World

Hi, I'm Sang.<br/>
A Frontend Developer at Aspire with 4+ years of experience in web development. My expertise lies in JavaScript and TypeScript, and I’m passionate about building efficient, high-performance web applications. My journey in programming began in high school, and over time, I've evolved my skills to create impactful digital experiences.

At Aspire, I actively contribute to the source code and participate in code reviews with my colleagues. I believe that collaboration and knowledge sharing are crucial in maintaining high-quality software. By working together as a team, we can spot potential issues early, improve code efficiency, and ensure the security of our applications.

This blog is where I’ll share insights from my experiences—whether it's about frontend development best practices, code reviews, or tips on effective teamwork. My goal is to provide value to both newcomers and experienced developers by exploring how to create better, more secure, and scalable applications through collaboration.



## Start today not tomorrow

_My motto to live by._
{:.lead}

> "Everything you care about, everything you are about, needs to begin today or it may never happen."

## Tomorrow never comes

What's something that you've put off doing till tomorrow? Did you really do it? I didn't think so.

Here is a list of things I said I'd do tomorrow:

- Clean the house
- Fix bugs
- Write a blog post
- Go to Gym
- Run for 20km

Many of those I pledged to start months ago. All with the same promise: Eh, I'll do that tomorrow.

## It's time to act

If it's worth the effort, you shouldn't wait. If it's not, then simply tell the truth: I don't want that badly enough. You'll feel better about yourself once you've started. Trust me. It gets easier as you go.

## Starting is hard

It requires courage and perseverance and all kinds of gumption. That's why most people simply talk about it, but never do it. That's why it's the hard part.

But starting is necessary. It's crucial to making your mark and leaving a legacy.
