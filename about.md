## Hello, World

Hi, I'm Sang.<br/>
A Frontend Developer at Aspire with 5+ years of hands-on experience building modern web applications. I specialise in JavaScript and TypeScript, and I love turning complex requirements into fast, elegant user experiences. My programming journey began back in high school, and ever since I’ve been honing my skills to create digital products that make a real impact.

At Aspire I contribute directly to the codebase and partner closely with teammates in thorough code reviews. I’m a strong believer in collaboration and knowledge-sharing: working together helps us spot issues early, boost performance, and keep our applications secure and maintainable.

This blog is my place to share what I’ve learned, whether it’s front-end best practices, code-review techniques, or tips for effective teamwork. My aim is to provide practical insights that help both new and seasoned developers build scalable, high-quality software through a culture of collaboration.



## Start today not tomorrow

_My motto to live by._
{:.lead}

> "Everything you care about, everything you are about, needs to begin today or it may never happen."

## Tomorrow never comes

What's something that you've put off doing till tomorrow? Did you really do it? I didn't think so.

Here is a list of things I said I'd do tomorrow:

- Clean the house
- Fix bugs
- Write a blog post
- Go to Gym
- Run for 20km

Many of those I pledged to start months ago. All with the same promise: Eh, I'll do that tomorrow.

## It's time to act

If it's worth the effort, you shouldn't wait. If it's not, then simply tell the truth: I don't want that badly enough. You'll feel better about yourself once you've started. Trust me. It gets easier as you go.

## Starting is hard

It requires courage and perseverance and all kinds of gumption. That's why most people simply talk about it, but never do it. That's why it's the hard part.

But starting is necessary. It's crucial to making your mark and leaving a legacy.
